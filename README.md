# PC-TED: A Learning-based Point Cloud Compression Toolkit for Training, Evaluation and Deployment

## Introduction

![](./assets/fig_overview.jpg)

PC-TED is a unified toolkit bridging research and practical application for learning-based point cloud compression. By consolidating training, evaluation, and deployment workflows, PC-TED facilitates systematic comparisons of compression algorithms with an emphasis on real-world applicability.

## Software Architecture

- **Model Zoo:** we have included common point cloud compression methods in the model zoo.
- **Compression Evaluator:** we currently include some metrics for evaluating the compression performance of algorithms.
- **Inference Evaluator:** we aim to provide hardware platform-independent metrics for evaluating inference performance.
- **Model Exportor:** the model exporter is to convert networks into the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format.

## Installation
We recommend using this toolkit with `Python 3.10`, `Pytorch 2.2.2` and `CUDA 11.8`.
```bash
conda create -n PC-TED python==3.10
conda activate PC-TED
pip install torch==2.2.2 torchvision==0.17.2 torchaudio==2.2.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

git clone â€”recursive https://gitee.com/rolfma/pc-ted.git
cd pc-ted
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Usage
- Model Zoo: Please refer to `examples/model_zoo.md`.
- Compression Evaluator and Inference Evaluator: Please refer to `examples/evaluator.py`.
- Model Exportor: Please refer to `examples/exportor.py`.
